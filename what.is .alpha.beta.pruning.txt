 Welcome Back,

This is the Decision Architecture podcast. A podcast about how decisions define us and how they donâ€™t. (giggles)

But first what is Alpha Beta Pruning according to academia,

Yea what she said. Time is a precious gift  because you only have a set amount of it.
You can make more money, but you can't make more time. When you give someone your time, 
you are giving them a portion of your life that you'll never get back. Your time is your life 

To avoid wasting too much time we should eliminate large amounts of choices from our decision tree
very similar to how artificial intelligent agents do. With a technique called..... Alpha-beta Pruning.

When alpha beta prunning is applied to a minimax tree it improves getting to the desired outcome without
wasting time going down uncessary paths.

Consider the Super Nintendo Game, Super Mario World.

*** A video clip is playing ***

If an intelligent agent is given the task to complete a level within the game the intelligent agent who never played the game 
before would have to try different strategies or approaches down a decision tree before coming up with a path that would lead to 
the goal.

Decision...... wait ** 1 sec ***

After Decision...... wait ** 1 sec ***

Decision...... wait ** 1 sec ***

*** Giggle *** Poor Mario.


Luckily with alpha beta pruning our little intelligent agent would be able to save time doing something reckless like going left 
instead right. Our Intelligent agent can prune away the idea that going left is a good idea or walking into object
like that monster over there.

So to summarize

When trying to reduce the computation time by a huge factor by cutting off branches in the decision tree because
there is a better branch available this is called ALPHA- BETA prunning
